 * Relative BM25 noise floor for MULTI-TERM natural-language queries only:
 * after sorting by score, drop hits scoring below this fraction of the top
 * score. Relative (not absolute) because BM25 magnitudes vary with corpus
 * size and document length, so a fixed score threshold would behave
 * inconsistently across short vs. long sessions.
 *
 * Applied only when the query has >=2 DISTINCT effective terms after
 * stopword filtering and case/duplicate normalization (see the
 * `effectiveTermCount >= 2` gate below `searchEntriesDetailed` uses before
 * calling `applyRelativeFloor`). Distinct, not raw count: "auth auth" or
 * "Auth AUTH" is semantically a single-term query and must bypass the floor
 * like any other single term — repeating or casing a word doesn't turn it
 * into the multi-term OR-tail noise this floor targets. The normalization is
 * gate-only; it doesn't change `terms` or the BM25 scoring itself, which
 * already matches case-insensitively. For a genuine single term, every hit's
 * occurrence already satisfies the whole query — its BM25 score differences
 * reflect term frequency and document length, not multi-term OR-tail noise,
 * so filtering by it there risks real matches for no corresponding noise
 * reduction. Evidence below confirmed this rather than assuming it.
 *
 * Evidence (scripts/benchmark-recall-quality.ts, run through this exact
 * production function via its `tuning` override — not a duplicate scoring
 * implementation). Two independent runs against real session corpora (23
 * sessions/161 queries and 31 sessions/222 queries; exact counts vary with
 * whatever real sessions are available locally, so both are reported rather
 * than treating one as a fixed target):
 *   - floor=0.20 on multi-term queries: median result count 49→23 (run 1,
 *     n=69) and 60.5→23.5 (run 2, n=98); p90 142.8→81 and 126.2→75.3.
 *     Zero-hit count stayed 0 in both runs, top-1 never changed (0/69,
 *     0/98). Top-5 membership shifted in 5/69 (7%) and 5/98 (5%).
 *   - floor=0.10 was too weak to "meaningfully" remove the tail (multi-term
 *     median only 49→39 / 60.5→42); floor=0.25 removed more but roughly
 *     doubled the multi-term top-5 disruption (8/69, run 1) for little extra
 *     median gain over 0.20. 0.20 is the least aggressive setting that
 *     meaningfully thinned the tail.
 *   - Single-term queries with the floor gated off: every floor candidate
 *     (0, 0.10, 0.20, 0.25) produced byte-identical results — 0/92 and
 *     0/124 top-5 changes in both runs, confirming the gate is a true no-op
 *     rather than an untested assumption. Before this gate existed, applying
 *     0.20 unconditionally still changed single-term top-5 in a small but
 *     non-zero fraction of queries (1/140 in this repo's own rerun, 1/124 in
 *     an independent reviewer rerun) for negligible median movement — real
 *     false-negative risk for no real noise benefit, which is why the gate
 *     exists.
 *
 * The top-scoring hit always survives by construction, independent of the
 * evidence above: its own score always satisfies `score >= topScore * floor`
 * for any floor <= 1, so a non-empty scored[] can never be filtered to zero.
